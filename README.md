# WebBlog
My first webproject with Vue.js

For front I use vue.js for back asp.net core.

This is a blog.
There are possibilities:

-read the last 10 articles and upload older ones
-register
+ for registered
-add, edit, delete article
The article consists of a title, a text and a signature which specifies the author's nickname.
